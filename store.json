      "description": "Broccoli contains a compound that can help fight against the bacteria that causes peptic ulcers. It has also been shown in studies to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and is being studied (along with cauliflower and cabbage) for its role in cancer prevention. It's also delicious raw or lightly steamed! Broccoli is an excellent source of immune-supportive vitamin C, anti-inflammatory vitamin K, free-radical-scavenging vitamin A (through its concentration of carotenoid phytonutrients), heart-healthy folate, and digestive-health-supporting fibre. It is a very good source of enzyme-activating manganese; muscular-system-supporting potassium, protein, and magnesium; energy-producing vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and phosphorus; and anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Additionally, it is a good source of energy-producing vitamin B1, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, and iron; bone-healthy calcium; and immune-supportive zinc and vitamin E"

      "description": "These organic carrots are nutritional heroes, they store a goldmine of nutrients. No other vegetable or fruit contains as much carotene as carrots, which the body converts to vitamin A. This is a truly versatile vegetable and an excellent source of vitamins B and C as well as calcium pectate, an extraordinary pectin fibre that has been found to have cholesterol-lowering properties. Raw carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A and potassium; they contain vitamin C, vitamin B6, thiamine, folic acid, and magnesium. Cooked carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A, a good source of potassium, and contain vitamin B6, copper, folic acid, and magnesium. The high level of beta-carotene is very important and gives carrots their distinctive orange colour."
